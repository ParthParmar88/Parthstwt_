Hi there!

Tutorial projects are a great way to get started with new technologies, but here’s the catch: copy pasting your way to the finish line won’t make you a better developer.

"Pro Tip: If you just finished a tutorial project and feel like you didn’t truly get it, do this:
Delete it. Then rebuild it from scratch — without looking back."

That’s where real learning happens.

When you rebuild:

You’ll discover the concepts you didn’t fully understand.

You’ll find yourself Googling and reading docs just like in real-world projects.

You’ll gain the confidence that you can create something on your own.

Tutorials are the training wheels. Rebuilding is where you actually learn to ride.

So next time you finish a tutorial, don’t just close the tab. Restart. Rebuild. Reinforce.
